                      <p>FreeFem++ embeds a powerful 2D mesh adaptation algorithm.</p>
                      <p>Mesh adaptation can be done in-situ during the simulation, as many times as necessary.</p>
                      <p>For 3D mesh adaptation, mmg3d and TetGen are available as plugins.</p>

                    <div>
                      <p>This is a simulation of scattering from the COBRA cavity of a plane wave incident upon the cavity aperture, obtained by solving the time-harmonic Maxwell equations.</p>
                      <p>The problem is discretized with order 2 Nédélec edge finite elements, with 10 mesh points per wavelength.</p>
                      <p>The resulting indefinite linear system has 198 million degrees of freedom at frequency f = 16 GHz.</p>
                      <p>The problem is solved in parallel by a two-level Schwarz domain decomposition method, with a total computing time of 363 seconds on 6144 cores.</p>

                      <p>This is a direct acoustic simulation with the SEG/EAGE Overthrust seismic model, obtained by solving the Helmholtz equation.</p>
                      <p>The problem is discretized with P2 Lagrange finite elements, with 5 mesh points per wavelength.</p>
                      <p>The mesh is adapted to the spatial variations of the velocity to obtain a constant number of points per wavelength in the whole domain to save computation time.</p>
                      <p>The resulting indefinite linear system has 678 million degrees of freedom at frequency f = 20 Hz.</p>
                      <p>The problem is solved in parallel by a Schwarz domain decomposition method, with a total computing time of 218 seconds on 12288 cores.</p>
